Please describe your findings along the following directions.

The recognition rate of my program. 79.47%

My method 

use endPointDetect.m to recognize them.

My optimization strategy 

Use exhaustive search to find a good volRatio about the training data. And use it in test data.
Although it may have larger error when using in test data, it can get faster.

Error analysis 

wavs with lots of noise will get bad recognition. In addition, because of the constance, so the performace will be limited with larger error.

Potential direction for further improvement 

find a better way to search a better volRatio.
